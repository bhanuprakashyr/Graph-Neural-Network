    "## Summary of what was fixed:\n",
    "- **Root cause**: Version incompatibility between NetworkX 2.8.5 and Matplotlib 3.10.3 causing `nx.draw()` to fail with `'_AxesStack' object is not callable`.\n",
    "- **Solution**: Upgraded NetworkX to 3.6.1 and switched from `nx.draw(G, with_labels=True)` to `nx.draw_networkx(G, pos, with_labels=True)` with a layout position (`pos = nx.spring_layout(G)`).\n",
    "- **Why this works**: `nx.draw_networkx()` is the core drawing function and avoids the buggy wrapper in `nx.draw()` for this Matplotlib version combo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your notebook kernel is now running properly, and since `G` is defined and executed, attribute completions like `G.` should show available methods/parameters without getting stuck on \"Loading...\". If completions are still slow or not appearing:\n",
    "- Ensure the kernel status shows \"Connected | Idle\".\n",
    "- Try typing `G.` and waiting 2-3 seconds.\n",
    "- Restart the Python language server if needed (Command Palette → \"Python: Restart Language Server\").\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now continue building and visualizing your graphs! If you add edges or more complex graphs, the same drawing approach will work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Made changes.\n"
