    "- `add_nodes_from(nodes, **attr)`: Same as undirected.\n",
    "- `add_edge(u, v, **attr)`: Adds a directed edge from u to v, with optional attributes.\n",
    "- `add_edges_from(edges, **attr)`: Adds multiple directed edges from an iterable of (u, v) pairs.\n",

    "- `update(other)`: Same as undirected.\n",
    "- `reverse()`: Returns a new graph with all edges reversed."
