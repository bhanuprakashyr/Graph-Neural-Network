A comprehensive tutorial series on graph theory and NetworkX in Python, designed to build strong foundations for understanding graph neural networks (GNNs).

## 🌟 Overview

This repository provides hands-on Jupyter notebooks that teach graph concepts from the ground up. Starting with basic graph operations, it progresses to advanced topics like weighted graphs, attributes, and real-world applications. Perfect for beginners transitioning to graph-based machine learning.
